## Instructions

Complete this tutorial while reading Sections 2.0-2.3 of the [textbook](https://nustat.github.io/intro-stat-ds/2-viz.html).

Once you are finished:

-   Click the 'grade' button at the top to retrieve your score.
-   Click the 'pdf' button to save the document as a pdf, you must have the tutorial open in a browser window for this button to work.
-   Submit the completed pdf to Canvas.


### Goals

-   Understand the essential components of the Grammar of Graphics.
-   Create a scatterplot.
-   Describe a scatterplot.
-   Understand the different aesthetics.


## Exercise

Construct a scatterplot of `eruptions` by `waiting` using the `faithful` dataset by filling in the blanks (the data is already preloaded in R).

```{r Ex1, exercise=TRUE}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = ___, y = ___)) +
  ____
```

```{r Ex1-hint-1}
Common language: y by x
```

```{r Ex1-hint-2}
Make sure you open and close parenthesis after geom_point
```

```{r Ex1-solution, exercise.reveal_solution = FALSE}
ggplot(data = faithful, mapping = aes(x = waiting, y = eruptions)) +
  geom_point()
```

```{r Ex1-code-check}
grade_this_code()
```

```{r Ex1-Q}
quiz(
  caption = "",
  question("Which of the following describes the relationship between eruptions and waiting? Check all that apply.",
           answer("Positive association",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Negative association",
                  message = "Look at the trend going from left to right"),
           answer("No association",
                  message = "Are you sure?"),
           answer("Linear",
                  correct = TRUE),
           answer("Non-linear",
                  message = "Check the graph again."),
